            "text": "Dynamic indications\nDynamic indications are indications of the \u201dloudness\u201d, or \u201dsound volume\u201d, of the music to be performed.\nThe basic dynamic indications are usually printed in bold \u201ditalics\u201d, and are given in the example below:\nThese\u00a0Italian\u00a0terms are explained here:\n\u00b7 pp,\u00a0pianissimo: very soft\n\u00b7 p,\u00a0piano: soft\n\u00b7 mp,\u00a0mezzo piano: medium soft\n\u00b7 mf,\u00a0mezzo forte: medium loud\n\u00b7 f,\u00a0forte: loud\n\u00b7 ff,\u00a0fortissimo: very loud\nIn contemporary composed music, the fourfold indications\u00a0pppp\u00a0and\u00a0ffff\u00a0are quite common, and even up to a sixfold\u00a0pppppp\u00a0can be found with a composer like Morton Feldman. Nevertheless all these indications are quite relative and one should not be mistaken about the apparent precision they seem to imply. In practice, many more shades and differences than e.g. MIDI allows for (128 steps) are possible, but it makes no sense trying to notate such fine nuances. When for example a whole passage is indicated\u00a0mf\u00a0it will be only a computer to play all these notes at the same volume; all performers subtly vary the loudness of individual notes, this practice is a normal organic element of human music in all styles and from all ages.\nOther terms are:\n\u00b7 fp,\u00a0fortepiano: a loud beginning, then an immediately soft sustained tone; variations such as\u00a0fpp\u00a0or\u00a0ffmp\u00a0and the like are also possible\n\u00b7 sfz,\u00a0sforzato\u00a0or\u00a0rf,\u00a0rinforzato: reinforced tone, especially at the beginning, which is generally less an accent but more a quick though gradual temporal loudness growing into and leaving the beginning of a tone\nGradual and sudden transitions of dynamics are also possible, both can be seen in the example below:\n\n\u00b7 crescendo, or\u00a0cresc.: getting louder gradually, it is also possible to indicate this by widening lines\n\u00b7 diminuendo, or\u00a0dim.\u00a0is the same as\u00a0decrescendo\u00a0or\u00a0decresc.: getting gradually softer, it is also possible to indicate this by narrowing lines\n\u00b7 subito, or\u00a0sub.: \u201csuddenly\u201d in\u00a0Italian, indicating a sudden transition to another, often unexpected, sound volume; typically, in the example above\u00a0ff\u00a0comes unexpectedly after a\u00a0diminuendo\u00a0and an unexpected\u00a0pp\u00a0after a\u00a0crescendo; the word\u00a0subito\u00a0not only clarifies this beyond doubt but more importantly a performer is more likely to not oversee this intended sudden dynamic transition\nAs a final remark to these indications being relative, let it be noted that for orchestral or big band use a\u00a0mf\u00a0for a trumpet more or less equals a\u00a0f\u00a0of a section of violins, (tenor or alto) saxophone or a french horn, and even a\u00a0ff\u00a0of a flute or solo violin, if measured in dB11. But all these dynamics depend not only on the\u00a0timbre12\u00a0but also on the register of the note played; for example a single piccolo playing\u00a0f\u00a0in its highest register can always be heard, even with 10 trumpets playing\u00a0ff\u00a0at the same time.\n\n",
